*********************************Instructions*********************************

You need to code the logic for controlling the snake and moving it around the
field while eating the various foods that appear on the field and increasing
its score and length.

All your logic and code goes inside the AI class.
There is absolutely no need to know about the code within other classes.

You are allowed to change and add only to AI.java class
None of the other classes should be altered. You need to submit only the AI.java file for the competition.

The run() function of the AI class will be called by the game controller to allow
your snake controlling logic to make its move. You need to add your code inside this
function. You can create your own functions and data members inside the class
as you require.

A set of functions inside the Game class are provided(which you can call using the game
object provided to the AI class) which you can use to know
the information about the current game state and playing your move.The functions provided are:
    public char[][] getField();
    public void moveLeft()
    public void moveRight()
    public void moveStraight()
    public Snake.Velocity getsnakeDirection()
    public boolean isFieldPositionEmpty(Point pos)
    public Point getFoodLocation()
    public Point getSpecialFoodLocation()
    public Integer getSpecialFoodPoints()
    public Point getSnakeHeadLocation()
    public Point getSnakeTailLocation()

    All the functions are properly documented for their easy use.
    The moveLeft(),moveRight() and moveStraight() functions are the ones that actually
    control the snake. If you call these functions multiple times within the same turn,
    only the last call will be effective.
    All other functions help to get the state of the playing field and information
    about various objects present on it.


**Important:  After the run() function of the AI class is called, your code will only be given
        a limited amount of time of 10 ms to play its move. If it does not make any move
        within the specified time the turn will be over and the snake will continue
        moving in its current direction.
Note:: All indexing is 0-based. The top left corner is considered as (0,0) with
        x-axis running left to right and y-axis top to bottom.

******************************GamePlay****************************************
You are controlling the snake that moves about on the field. The snake needs to
move around without colliding with the walls of the field. If such a collision occurs,
the snake will DIE and the game will be over.
Also the field has food on it for the snake to feed on.
The food is of two types:
    1)Normal food: Always present on the field. On eating it increases the score of
       the snake by one point and the snake's length also gets increased by one.
       If the snake eats it, instantly its length grows and another food is generated
       somewhere else on the field.
    2)Special food: Only sometimes present on the field( present along with the
       normal food). On eating it affects the snake's
       score but does not affect its length. This food has an effect of
       (+/-)(1-5) on the score, that means it can both increase or decrease the
       score on being eaten.The snake needs to be Careful.. ;)
       Moreover, this food remains only for a certain time after which it disappears.
       ( Can be both good as well as bad news for the snake ;) )
The snake also cannot collide with itself. This also results in the snake's death.
You need to try and score maximum points before the game gets over.
Your score is the score present when the game gets over.

************************Running instructions********************************
Two version of the game will be provided one for running from netbeans and other
for running from command line.
Game.java is the main file.
For running from command line:
    All source files and compiled files are present inside the kodekraft folder.
    Edit the Ai.java file.Compile it from command line.
    Run the command : java Game
For running on netbeans:
    Just edit the Ai.java file and run the kodekraft project.

*******************************Submission********************************
You need to upload email your Ai.java file to KodeKraftSubmit@gmail.com along with
your team's members' names and your technozion registration ids.
Any queries about the game or the tasks involved can be mailed to kodekraft.tz13@gmail.com .
Only one submission per team is allowed. 

***************************Judging*******************************************
Your code will be run by us on our machines. The code will be run for multiple
different times. The average of the final scores of each run will be taken as the
score of your team.
The top 25 teams who would have the highest average scores will advance to the final
onsite round during technozion.
